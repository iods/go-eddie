### Weight

You have only one main option with this record, and that is the average value (in pounds) of your weight,
taken over a 24 hr period. You are also given the `--important` flag for tagging it with significance.

You can track your weight using the following patterns:
```sh
$ eddie track weight 195
$ eddie track weight 195 -i, --important
```

You will see the record created return its ID, but nothing more.

You can view progress and trends with:
```sh
$ eddie report weight
```
